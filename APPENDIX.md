# 📎 Appendix: AI Meets Number Theory & Cryptography 🔍🤖

This appendix offers **creative, interdisciplinary extensions** to your number theory + cryptography journey, integrating techniques from machine learning, reinforcement learning, and modern deep learning (inspired by [d2l.ai](https://d2l.ai/)).

## 🔢 1. **Prime Pattern Prediction with Machine Learning**
### 🔍 Goal:
Train ML models to **predict whether a number is prime** (classification task) or **predict the gap to the next prime** (regression task).

### Techniques:
- Logistic Regression / SVM / Decision Trees
- Feature Engineering: number of divisors, modulo patterns, digital root, etc.
- Neural Networks for better generalization

## 📊 2. **Using CNNs on Ulam Spiral Images**
### 🔍 Goal:
- Convert **prime distributions in spiral plots** into images.
- Use **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to detect visual patterns in primes.

### Pipeline:
- Generate Ulam spiral (2D grid where primes are marked)
- Treat as binary image: 1 = prime, 0 = non-prime
- Train CNN to classify grid regions or predict prime "density"

## 🧠 3. **Transformers for Symbolic Math**
### 🔍 Goal:
Use transformer models to simulate symbolic manipulation:
- Predict modular inverse steps
- Emulate Euclidean algorithm
- Perform prime factorization steps

### Tools:
- Fine-tune GPT-like models on number-theoretic operations
- Use self-attention to “learn” arithmetic patterns

---

## 🔐 4. **LSTM or GRU for Prime Sequence Modeling**
### 🔍 Goal:
Use RNNs to model the prime sequence:
- Learn to predict the next probable prime
- Understand long-term structure of gaps

### Strategy:
- Encode input as delta between consecutive primes
- Train LSTM to predict next delta or flag a prime position

## 🎰 5. **Reinforcement Learning for Cryptanalysis**
### 🔍 Goal:
Train an RL agent to:
- Guess RSA factors with limited probes
- Simulate side-channel attacks (e.g. power/timing analysis)

### Techniques:
- Use Gym-like environment with reward on correct factor guess
- Model attack strategies as Markov Decision Processes

---

## 🧪 6. **Anomaly Detection on RNG Streams**
### 🔍 Goal:
- Use unsupervised ML to find anomalies in randomness streams (e.g. PRNG vs TRNG).
- Train autoencoders or clustering models to detect bias, periodicity.

### Application:
- RNG certification
- Cryptographic entropy assessment

## 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks
- Python: PyTorch / TensorFlow / NumPy / SymPy
- d2l.ai notebooks for deep learning models
- matplotlib + seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter notebooks for exploratory work

## 📦 Suggested Projects
- 🔐 Build a model that flags weak RSA keys by training on simulated vulnerable keys.
- 🎲 Create a discriminator that tells apart true random bitstreams vs. PRNG-generated.
- 🔎 Use attention mechanisms to trace proof steps for number-theoretic identities.
