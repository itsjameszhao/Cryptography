# 🤖 AI/ML/RL for Cryptography: Applications, Ideas & Research Directions 🔐

This document explores how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, and **Deep Learning (DL)** can intersect with and augment **modern cryptographic systems** — from RSA to randomness, key analysis, and side-channel attacks.

## 🧠 Why Use AI in Cryptography?

While classical cryptography is built on firm mathematical theorems, AI brings:
- Pattern recognition
- Probabilistic modeling
- Adaptivity & search optimization
- Creative synthesis of mathematical structure

## 🔑 Cryptographic Targets for AI

| Area | Classical Role | AI Enhancement |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **Primality Testing** | Miller–Rabin, ECPP | Neural classifiers or predictors |
| **Factorization** | Integer factorization (RSA) | RL-guided attack strategies |
| **Randomness** | TRNGs and PRNGs | Anomaly detection, bias quantification |
| **Side-channel attacks** | Timing/power analysis | Signal analysis using CNNs, RNNs |
| **Key generation** | Secure, high-entropy keys | Entropy estimation, pattern detection |
| **Cryptanalysis** | Break ciphers | Sequence modeling, adversarial learning |

## 🧪 Example Applications

### 🔍 1. Prime Classification as ML Task
Train models to predict if an integer is prime:
- Input: Encoded integer (binary, digit pattern, modulo residue)
- Output: Binary label (prime/composite)
- Models: MLPs, transformers, LSTMs
- Limitation: No guarantee, but fast filters

---

### 🔐 2. Neural RSA Key Classifier
Goal: Train a model to distinguish **weak** vs **strong** RSA keys.
- Features: entropy of p, q; shared bits; time to generate
- Use: flag keys from flawed entropy sources (e.g., broken RNGs)

---

### 📉 3. Deep Learning for Side-Channel Attacks
- Input: Timing traces, power consumption curves
- Task: Predict secret key bits
- Models: CNNs (image-like input), RNNs (time series)
- Real-world: Used in analyzing smartcards, embedded chips

---

### 🧩 4. Reinforcement Learning to Break Ciphers
- Simulate RL agent in a crypto puzzle environment
- Reward = amount of message decoded or error reduced
- Action = guess key segment, probe oracle
- Environment = black-box cipher system

---

### 📊 5. GANs to Detect or Generate “Crypto-like” Numbers
- Train GANs to generate prime-like numbers, or RSA-like moduli
- Use discriminator to spot suspicious key material or faulty PRNGs

---

## 🔧 Tools and Frameworks

- **Python + PyTorch / TensorFlow**
- **NumPy + SymPy** (for number theory)
- **scikit-learn** for classic models
- **Keras + D2L** for quick prototypes
- **Crypto libraries**: `pycryptodome`, `cryptography`, `rsa`

---

## 🎯 Research Challenges

- 🔐 No zero-error tolerance in cryptography → ML must be support, not a replacement
- 📉 Encoding large numbers for ML is hard
- 🧠 Extracting interpretable insights from models trained on cryptographic data

---

## 🌍 Frontier Research Examples

- Neural Distinguisher Models (AES, hash functions)
- Transformer models for symbolic math and cipher structure learning
- Autoencoders for RSA key vulnerability analysis
- Side-channel power leakage models using vision architectures

---

## 🔮 Your Research Ideas to Try

- Build a transformer that learns modular exponentiation
- Use RL to optimize key brute-forcing strategies under cost constraints
- Train a model to score entropy quality of RNG bitstreams
- Develop a CNN model to identify hardware noise patterns linked to key leakage

Cryptography is **truth-dependent**, AI is **pattern-dependent** — the intersection creates a space where pattern can **reveal flaws** in assumptions of truth.

> This is where the future of crypto-auditing, quantum-resistance, and post-quantum attack strategy may lie.
